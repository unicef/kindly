# ðŸ“… Progress Timeline

**2020** 
  - Gitanjali Rao launches her proof-of-concept for Kindly, an AI-based, anti-cyberbullying service. Her initial work included a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model developed using Microsoft Azure's Language Understanding (LUIS) cloud-based engine. The data is manually reviewed and added to LUIS. The proof of concept includes an API, a Chrome Extension, and a standalone app.
  - A small dataset was collected directly from contributions by children who learned about Kindly through Gitanjaliâ€™s social media outreach and local community launch of the beta version of the product.
  - UNICEF <a href = "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.voicesofyouth.org/blog/future-internet-safety-reimagined&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1636499706053000&usg=AOvVaw1ABIoLrLJPwocJDeJ6NKFL"> profiles Gitanjali Rao</a> in the Voices of Youth global community, where Gitanjali blogs about Internet safety, protection against discrimination, and protection against cyberbullying.


**July 2021**

**September 2021**
- Kindlyâ€™s vision document is vetted by UNICEFâ€™s Child Protection unit. 
- Kindlyâ€™s development efforts begin. An open-source machine learning (ML) model is trained on an existing public dataset consisting of 50 million tweets, authored by adults
- An initial API is developed and internally tested.


**October 2021**
- A front-end demo interface where users can get a feel for what Kindly can do is developed. The demo is meant to show an example of what the integration of Kindly with an existing service can look like.
