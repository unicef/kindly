# Overview

To bootstrap the Kindly machine learning model, we were faced with a chicken-and-egg problem: do we model and get the data first? Or do we start with a basic outline of how we would work with a similar data set? Since some data had been collected already for this project, we decided to look into other existing strategies that had the structure of data we had, while simultaneously setting up code for the project to also demonstrate how Kindly would work through an API.
