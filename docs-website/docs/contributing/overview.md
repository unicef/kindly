# ü§ù Contributing

There are multiple ways to contribute to, and work with, the Kindly project:

## Training Data
We are collecting training data from children on the [Kindly website](https://kindly.unicef.io/contribute). These contributions will be added to the [training dataset](ml-model/training-data) which are classified as either `offensive` or `non-offensive` to improve the model's accuracy. See the [training data docs](../ml-model/training-data) for a more technical overview. See our [Privacy and Terms of Use](https://kindly.unicef.io/legal) page for information on privacy, how we use data and terms of usage.

## [Project Maintenance](project-maintenance)
Kindly is built as an open-source solution, and is a certified [DPG](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/kindly.html). We are on [GitHub](https://github.com/unicef/kindly) and will welcome your help whatever your skills. Check out [this page](project-maintenance) to learn more about our contribution guidelines.
